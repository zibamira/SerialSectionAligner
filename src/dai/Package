# libdai has been imported with the full history that has been rewritten to
# move all files to a subdirectory.  The latest rewritten upstream commit is
#
#     zib-amira:5842343b9401aa2cf9736ad947f64348d5d19af7 Fixed some more
#     BOOST_CHECK_CLOSE misuse
#
# which corresponds to the original upstream commit
#
#     libdai:96078cb185aa99a52454fcb7c29503df56f5e3d7 Fixed some more
#     BOOST_CHECK_CLOSE misuse
#
# The upstream repo is at <git://git.tuebingen.mpg.de/libdai.git>.
#
# The directory layout has later been changed: the original source in now in a
# separate directory `upstream/`;  the package root dir contains forwarding
# headers.
#
# Instead of applying individual upstream commits, we should consider importing
# a specific upstream version all at once.  It might not be obvious, because
# zib-amira.git contains some local modifications to libdai.
